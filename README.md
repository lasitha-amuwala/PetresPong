## What is Petres Pong?
This is a rework of a Pong game that I made in highschool as a joke.

The original was made using Prosessing and fairly simple code, I've made some improvments since then.

- Menu screens
- Interactive buttons 
- Score board
- 2 modes: single-player and multiplayer
- AI for single player
- Responsive UI
- Nice UI
- Hosted on Githup Pages
